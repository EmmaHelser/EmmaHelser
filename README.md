### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Emma and I am a Software Engineer

Have you ever tried to create and teach three dances to a group of people that only really had time to learn one? I have and it takes a bit of patience, some problem solving, and a whole lot of creativity.

I may not be teaching wedding parties any more, but I am using these skills as a software engineer to creatively solve problems and meet usersâ€™ needs. Whether that's a redesign of an existing product page or dog poop removal app, creating a great user experience and meeting client needs is the top priority.

Current Tech Stack:
JavaScript, React, React Native, Node.JS, Express.JS, MySQL, HTML, CSS
